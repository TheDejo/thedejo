## Hi there, I am Divine Ogbe ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer mainly into frontend web technologies and I like to contribute to opensource.

What drives my work ethic is building products that are user-centered, expecting to see a real impact from the works that I take on. I enjoy approaching code from a different point of view considering a great user interface as well as seamless functionality.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on opensource.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript and React
